### Data Course Project

This repository is a **Carlos Aguilar** submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It contains a code book, an R script on the analysis of the Human Activity recognition dataset and a text file with the final data.

### Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

### Files
+ ```Code Book.md``` is a file that describes the steps taken to prepare the data and develope the R script.  
+ ```run_analysis.R``` is a script that performs the data preparation and analysis as described in the course project's definition:
    + Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    + Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    + Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    + Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    + From the data set in step 4, a new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject is created.
+ ```processed_data.txt``` is the exported final data which results from the steps previously described.
